# About esx_aircraftshop:
Aircraft dealer for esx servers.

This is a aircraft dealer/shop that works exactly as "esx_vehicleshop" but instead of buying cars you buy aircrafts.
I did't code this script, i just edited a lot so it works perfectly. But why? yes there is another esx_aicratshop but that 1 doesn't work for me and
you can get your aircrafts out of your normal vehicle garage. In the sql file it makes a table named: "owned_aircrafts" and it will save the aircrafts you bought there
and not in "owned_vehicles" so you can only take it out of specific garages. 


# NOTE:
If you have a garage script make sure it searches for "owned_aircrafts" instead of "owned_vehicles" so you can 
get the aircrafts out of the garage!

# How to put it in your server?:
1) Download the .zip.
2) Extract or open the zip file.
3) Import `esx_aircraftshop.sql` in your database.
4) Place `esx_aircraftshop` in your server files.
5) Add `start esx_aircraftshop` to your server.cfg.
